# CART 315 Iterative Prototype 

<b>Design Hypothesis 1 </b>  

<br>

By providing a tutorial level to get playtesters familiar with the controls, I believe that the playtesters will get a better understanding of the sensitive controls and feel better guided with instructions. So if I provide them with a very plain and simple gameplay at first l, then the player will feel confident that the game will be super easy and perhaps boring. That said, if I add an invisible countdown timer to the last and very difficult stage, will the player feel the same confidence and pressure to finish?

<b>List of questions for playtesters 1</b>
<ol><li>Do you think the tutorial stage was helpful?</li>
  <li>What did you think of the duality between the second stage and the last stage?</li>
  <li>How do you think of going sideways with this camera angle?</li>
  <li>What do you think of the soundtrack? Should it be repeated at each level or not?</li>
  <li>How many tries (and times do they get caught up by the timer) till the player gave up? Did you feel like you should give up? </li>
  <li>What do you think of the invisible timer?</li></ol>
